# Introduction
In this article, we will go over a few things that users need to consent to prior to using ArticBot on this server. If you have added ArticBot to your server before this was set up, you will need to run `d$manualverification` to verify that you have read the ArticBot ToS.

## Usage Policy
All commands require different levels of permissions. Currently, commands like Kick, Ban, Purge, Warn, Lockdown, etc. are restricted to Administrators only.

The bot owner (AlanTheGreat#0001) can by default run any of these commands in any guild without permission. To prevent this, simply use `$setconf botOwnerRestricted true` to restrict the bot owner from running administrator commands in your guild without permission.

## Tracking Policy
We track when a guild is added or removed, and some data about the guild. This data can include, and is not limited to:
  - ID
  - Channels
  - Members<br>
 This information is only used to do some behind-the-scenes configuration in ArticBot for your server.
 
 ## The End
 That's all for now, more will come shortly.
